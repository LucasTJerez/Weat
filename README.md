## Revolutionizing Food Delivery

We are building an app that allows customers to place orders from local NYC restaurants in advance, so that meals can be bulked delivered, saving up to 5x on on-demand delivery. Weat is an alternative to on-demand delivery apps like Grubhub, Postmates, and UberEats, that rewards its users for ordering food in advance.

Not only are the customers saving, restaurants no longer have to lose up to 30% of their revenue due to the inefficiency of on-demand delivery, and can also save by preparing orders in advance.

## Tech Stack

We are using Firebase's Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Functions as our backend, and we are building Andriod and IOS front ends using react-native.
